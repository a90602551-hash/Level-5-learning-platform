                        However, many students disagree with the reading. They think uniforms are not always good. First, uniforms stop students from showing who they are. Young people need to learn about themselves. They want to choose their own clothes. This is part of growing up. When schools force students to wear uniforms, students cannot express themselves. This is a problem.

                        Second, uniforms don't really save money. The reading says uniforms are cheaper than regular clothes. But this is not true. Parents must buy uniforms from special stores. These stores are very expensive. Also, students need many uniforms because they wear them every day. So uniforms actually cost more money, not less.

Students can study well with or without uniforms. What really helps students is good teaching and interesting lessons. Schools should focus on teaching, not on what students wear.
